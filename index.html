            <div class="card-content">
                <p>The Watergate scandal was a major political crisis in the United States during the early 1970s that ultimately led to the resignation of President Richard Nixon. It began with a break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate office complex in Washington, D.C., and evolved into a constitutional crisis involving abuse of power, obstruction of justice, and coverup at the highest levels of government.</p>

            <div class="card-description">June 17, 1972</div>
            <div class="card-content">
                <p>On June 17, 1972, five men were arrested for breaking into the Democratic National Committee headquarters located in the Watergate complex. The burglars were caught attempting to wiretap phones and steal documents. Initial reports suggested it was a simple burglary, but investigative journalism would soon reveal connections to President Nixon's reelection campaign.</p>

            <div class="card-title">The Smoking Gun Tape</div>
            <div class="card-content">
                <p>The most damaging evidence against Nixon was a tape recording from June 23, 1972, just days after the break-in. It revealed Nixon discussing using the CIA to obstruct the FBI's investigation, proving his direct involvement in the coverup. This tape became known as the "smoking gun" and sealed his fate.</p>

            <div class="card-content">
                <p>As investigations deepened, it became clear that senior officials in the Nixon administration had attempted to cover up the administration's involvement in the break-in. Nixon and his aides engaged in numerous illegal activities including obstruction of justice, abuse of power, and contempt of Congress. The revelation that Nixon had secretly recorded all conversations in the Oval Office became crucial evidence.</p>

            <div class="card-content">
                <p>When Nixon refused to release the tape recordings, citing executive privilege, a constitutional battle ensued. The case went to the Supreme Court, which unanimously ruled in United States v. Nixon that the president must release the tapes. This landmark decision established that the president is not above the law and cannot use executive privilege to withhold evidence in a criminal investigation.</p>
                <p>The tapes revealed Nixon's direct involvement in the coverup, leading the House Judiciary Committee to adopt articles of impeachment charging him with obstruction of justice, abuse of power, and contempt of Congress.</p>

                <p>Facing certain impeachment and removal from office, Richard Nixon resigned on August 8, 1974, effective the following day. In his resignation speech, he stated that he no longer had "a strong enough political base in Congress" to continue. Vice President Gerald Ford assumed the presidency and controversially pardoned Nixon one month later, preventing any criminal prosecution.</p>

                <p>On October 20, 1973, Nixon ordered Attorney General Elliot Richardson to fire Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox, who had subpoenaed the White House tapes. Richardson refused and resigned in protest. Deputy Attorney General William Ruckelshaus also refused and was fired. Solicitor General Robert Bork finally carried out the order, but the public outcry was immense and led to increased calls for impeachment.</p>

            <div class="card-description">How Watergate Changed America</div>
            <div class="card-content">
                <p>In response to the abuses revealed by Watergate, Congress passed numerous reforms including the Ethics in Government Act, which established procedures for the appointment of special prosecutors. Campaign finance laws were strengthened, and new oversight mechanisms were put in place to prevent future abuses of executive power.</p>
                <p>The scandal fundamentally altered Americans' relationship with their government. Trust in political institutions declined sharply and has never fully recovered. The media became more adversarial in its coverage of government, and citizens became more skeptical of official statements and explanations.</p>
                <p>Watergate demonstrated the critical role of a free press in democracy. The investigative journalism of Woodward, Bernstein, and others showed that journalists could hold even the most powerful accountable. This inspired a generation of investigative reporters and reinforced First Amendment protections.</p>
                <p>The suffix "-gate" has since been attached to countless political scandals worldwide, from "Irangate" to "Bridgegate." The scandal has been the subject of numerous books, films, and documentaries, ensuring that its lessons remain part of our collective memory.</p>
